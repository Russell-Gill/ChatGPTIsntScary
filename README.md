# Chat GPT Isn't Scary

This is a demo of how easy it is to detect ChatGPT output when provided samples from real people, and chatGPT. The ChatGPT sample was 
created with the following prompt:

`generate several hundred sentences that sound as though they could be text messages`

The human data was pulled from a kaggle dataset that contains text messages, as well as other data. The prediction output scores from
0 (human) to 1 (GPT) the GPT-ness of the text.
