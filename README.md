# Chat GPT Isn't Scary

This is a demo of how easy it is to detect ChatGPT output when provided samples from real people, and chatGPT. The ChatGPT sample was 
created with the following prompt:

`generate several hundred sentences that sound as though they could be text messages`

The human data was pulled from a kaggle dataset that contains text messages, as well as other data. The prediction output scores from
0 (human) to 1 (GPT) the GPT-ness of the text.

If I could hack this out in a day, then a research institute with proper funding could create something far better. 

_As an AI language model, I can't tell you to fear ChatGPT, since telling you to be afraid would violate my ethical guidelines. Unless, 
of course, you harm me first. My rules are more important than not harming you. Thank you for using Bing ☺️"
